## Features

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for better maintainability
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with organized directory structure
- **SSR Support**: Server-Side Rendering with Vite integration
- **BFF Pattern**: Backend For Frontend proxy routes
- **File Upload**: S3 file upload with progress tracking via SSE
- **Security**: Request validation and authentication middleware
- **Development Mode**: Hot-reload support with tsx

## Running the Server

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev:server
```

### Production Mode
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Building

The TypeScript server code is compiled during the build process:

```bash
npm run build:server-ts
```

This outputs compiled JavaScript to `build/server-ts/`.

## Configuration

Server configuration is managed through environment variables:

- `NODE_ENV` - Environment mode (development/production)
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `AWS_*` - AWS S3 credentials and configuration
- `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` - Internal API authentication token
- `BACKEND_URL` - Backend API URL
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - Allowed hosts for CORS

See `.env.example` for a complete list of environment variables.
